1. Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks
2. How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time
3. Implement pop_at_index(index) method which pops element at the given index from the stack
